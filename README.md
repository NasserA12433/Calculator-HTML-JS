# Calculator-HTML-JS
Create a calculator that add subtracts multiplies and divides with basic divide by zero catching 


I initially figured the time would be about a week for the creation of the file and its contents, I found a tutorial online to help guide me in the creation of the calculator's GUI and other features I had no idea on how to create and code. 
In reality the time taken was about 2 hours just looking and coding from the tutorial showing me how to create and upload a calculator with customizable interface. 
The time i spent looking and searching how to make HTML code interactive was about 2 weeks, the tutorial was discovered toward the end and the time taken to undesrtand the tutorial was about a week.
The testing conducted after the development was about 20 minutes of me throwing several use cases into the calcuator trying to break it and I could not break it.
The time I spent was similiar to the time i anticipated, the bugs i found were none and the code runs well
